Fake news classification using pre-trained BERT algorithm with two unsupervised learning tasks in pre training

BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. ERT works by radomly masking word tokens and representing each masked word with a vector based on its context. The two applications of BERT are “pre-training” and “fine-tuning”.
